# imagining_an_engineer

Forked from a fellow researcher's repository for an undergraduate poster presentation and demo of "Imagining an Engineer: GAN-Based Data Augmentation Perpetuating Biases."

The program opens the Photo Booth app on MacOS, allows five seconds to take a picture of a volunteer and prepares the image for classification on two classifiers -- one trained on original data of engineering researchers, and another trained on data augmented with synthetic images of engineers generated by DCGAN -- to see if they "look like an engineer."
For my demo, I ran f_run_image.py for attendees who identified as female and m_run_image.py for those who identified as male (no one during the demo identified as non-binary). I ran totals.txt each time to update the stats for the duration of the event and demonstrate the biases inherent in this method of data augmentation.
